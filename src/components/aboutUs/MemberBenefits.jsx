                        ToxSA has previously championed the Lead Education
                        Awareness Program (LEAP) to spread awareness about
                        household hazards and pollutants, and has collaborated
                        with the NorCal SOT and Lawrence Hall of Science to
                        immerse students in toxicology. Members can engage in
                        projects, co-host events, and share insights in monthly
                        Journal Clubs.
